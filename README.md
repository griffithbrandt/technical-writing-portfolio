## About Me

I'm an Embedded Systems Engineering student with a unique background in Cinema Studies, allowing me to create technical documentation that is both accurate and visually engaging. Currently seeking a Technical Editor internship where I can help bridge the gap between complex engineering concepts and clear, actionable documentation.

## Portfolio Highlights

### [Diagnostic Procedures](./diagnostic-procedures/)
Step-by-step troubleshooting guides for embedded systems, demonstrating my ability to translate complex technical processes into clear instructions for service technicians.

### [API Documentation](./api-documentation/)
Comprehensive reference documentation for the VESTA voice assistant system, showcasing my ability to document software interfaces and integration points.

### [Hardware Documentation](./hardware-documentation/)
Assembly instructions and 3D design documentation that combine technical accuracy with visual clarity.

### [System Architecture](./system-architecture/)
High-level technical documentation explaining complex system interactions for cross-functional teams.

###  [Service Documentation](./service-documentation/)
Error code references and service bulletins that help technicians quickly identify and resolve issues.

## Featured Project: VESTA Voice Assistant

VESTA (Virtual Enhanced Speech and Text Assistant) is a fully functional AI-powered voice assistant I developed as my junior project. This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Document complex hardware/software integration
- Create diagnostic procedures for real systems
- Write API documentation for developers
- Develop user-friendly guides for non-technical users

### Technical Stack
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 5, MEMS microphones, touch sensors, custom 3D enclosure
- **Software**: Python, OpenAI API, speech recognition, I2C/I2S protocols
- **Documentation**: Markdown, XML/DITA concepts, visual diagrams
